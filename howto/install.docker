Install Docker on Ubuntu Using Default Repositories
Step 1: Update Software Repositories

As usual, it’s a good idea to update the local database of software to make sure you’ve got access to the latest revisions.

Therefore, open a terminal window and type:

sudo apt-get update

Allow the operation to complete.
Step 2: Uninstall Old Versions of Docker

Next, it’s recommended to uninstall any old Docker software before proceeding.

Use the command:

sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io

Step 3: Install Docker

To install Docker on Ubuntu, in the terminal window enter the command:

sudo apt install docker.io

Step 4: Start and Automate Docker

The Docker service needs to be setup to run at startup. To do so, type in each command followed by enter:

sudo systemctl start docker

sudo systemctl enable docker





DOCKER COMPOSE


Download the Docker Compose binary into the /usr/local/bin directory with the following curl command:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


Once the download is complete, apply executable permissions to the Compose binary:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


Verify the installation by running the following command which will display the Compose version:

docker-compose --version
